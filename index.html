            <h2>About PupasProject</h2>
            <p>
                PupusaProject was founded today <time datetime="2024/01/11">1/11/2024</time> in response to an exercise for HTML in order to practice. Initially called Little Pupusas Project <abbr title="Little Pupas Project">LPP</abbr>, but later I changed the name. This is a virtual shop that <strong>loves pupusas</strong>ðŸ«“ðŸ«“ðŸ«“. We hope this shop adds a gracious style to this exercise. At PupusaProject we believe that pupusas are more than just a culinary delight; they are a celebration of culture, tradition, and community. Our mission is to share the rich history and diverse flavors of pupusas, connecting people from all walks of life through the joy of these stuffed delights.
            </p>
            <p>Bienvenidos and enjoy the journey into the delectable universe of pupusas!</p>
